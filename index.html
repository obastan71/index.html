                <p><strong>Logline:</strong> A respected community leader who preaches virtue is publicly exposed by his wife when his secret affair threatens to destroy their two families.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PASTOR EPHRAIM (40s):</strong> Charismatic, well-dressed, a pillar of the community.</li>
                    <li><strong>SARAH (40s):</strong> Ephraim's wife. Gentle and reserved, but with a fire burning beneath the surface.</li>

                    <li><strong>DEBORAH (40s):</strong> Mark's wife.</li>

                <p><strong>SCENE START</strong></p>
                <p><strong>INT. PASTOR'S OFFICE - DAY</strong></p>
                <p>A pristine, book-lined office. PASTOR EPHRAIM sits at his large desk, a sermon open on his laptop. He is rehearsing his lines into a small microphone, his voice smooth and confident.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>True leadership is not about being the shepherd. It's about being the lamb. It's about living a life of unimpeachable integrity, because our Lord sees all.</blockquote>
                <p>He smiles to himself, pleased with the line. A phone on the desk vibrates with a text message. He glances at it, a private smirk playing on his lips. He quickly types a reply. Just then, SARAH enters, a laundry basket in her arms.</p>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Putting these away. Mark asked if you were coming over later.</blockquote>
                <p>Ephraim's phone buzzes again. He quickly puts it face down on the desk.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Oh, I can't. The gala tonight. My message has to be... flawless.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Your message on integrity?</blockquote>
                <p>He gives her a tight smile, trying to gauge her meaning.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Is there a problem, Sarah?</blockquote>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Just an observation. The truth is timeless, isn't it?</blockquote>
                <p>She turns and exits, her words hanging in the air. Ephraim's relaxed posture stiffens.</p>
                <p><strong>INT. MARK AND DEBORAH'S HOUSE - DAY</strong></p>
                <p>MARK is in the kitchen, beaming as he talks on his phone, oblivious to DEBORAH, who is picking at her lunch with a worried expression.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>I'm telling you, he's a true man of God. Ephraim gave me some of the best advice I've ever received on being a good husband. Said it was the most important calling a man could have.</blockquote>
                <p>He laughs into the phone.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Absolutely! See you tonight, brother!</blockquote>
                <p>He hangs up and puts an arm around Deborah.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>The gala's going to be great. It's an honor to have a man like him guiding our community.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>DEBORAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>He is... a guide.</blockquote>
                <p>Her voice is flat. Mark doesn't notice.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>What's wrong, honey? You seem distant.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>DEBORAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Nothing. Just... the weight of it all. It's a lot to live up to.</blockquote>
                <p>Mark kisses her forehead.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>We can only try our best. He's a true servant.</blockquote>
                <p>Deborah turns away, her face a mixture of shame and despair.</p>
                <p><strong>INT. CHURCH PARLOR - NIGHT</strong></p>
                <p>A fundraising gala is in full swing. Laughter and music fill the air. PASTOR EPHRAIM, confident and smiling, holds court with a small group of church elders. He sips from a glass of sparkling water.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>And that, my friends, is the simple truth. Integrity isn’t what you preach; it’s what you live when no one is watching.</blockquote>
                <p>He gestures to the crowd, basking in their appreciative nods.</p>
                <p>Across the room, SARAH watches him. Her face is a mask of calm, but her eyes are cold. MARK and DEBORAH, standing beside her, look uncomfortable.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Sarah, are you sure you're okay? You've barely touched your food.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>I’m fine, Mark. Just a little tired of the theatrics.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>DEBORAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>She's been a rock through all of this. What an example of grace under pressure.</blockquote>
                <p>Sarah's gaze drifts from Deborah to Ephraim. A sharp pang of betrayal hits her.</p>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Grace? I've been a spectator to a sin. Not an example of grace.</blockquote>
                <p>Deborah and Mark exchange a confused look.</p>
                <p><strong>MARK</strong></p>
                <blockquote>What are you talking about, Sarah?</blockquote>
                <p>Sarah ignores him. Her eyes lock with Ephraim's from across the room. He gives her a tight, polite smile.</p>
                <p>Sarah begins to walk towards him, a single-minded determination in her stride. The chatter in the room dies down as people notice the tension. Ephraim's smile falters.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Sarah, darling. Everything alright?</blockquote>
                <p>He reaches for her arm, but she pulls away as if his touch is a flame.</p>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Don't call me that. We're doing this now. All of us.</blockquote>
                <p>She looks at Mark and Deborah, who have now caught up to her.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>This isn't the place.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Oh, I think it's the perfect place. It's in this very room, surrounded by people who hang on your every word, that you've built your kingdom of lies.</blockquote>
                <p>The crowd falls silent. All eyes are on them.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Sarah, please. Don't make a scene.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>You made the scene, Ephraim. For months. You made a mockery of your vows. Of my life. And of their marriage.</blockquote>
                <p>Her voice cracks, but her gaze remains firm on Deborah.</p>
                <p><strong>DEBORAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>What is she talking about?</blockquote>
                <p>Sarah's eyes fill with tears, but she doesn't break her stare.</p>
                <p><strong>SARAH</strong></p>
                <blockquote>Ask your husband. Ask the man who preaches fidelity, yet spends his nights in hotel rooms with another man's wife. Your wife, Mark. Your wife.</blockquote>
                <p>The words hang in the air like a thunderclap. The room erupts in gasps and whispers. Mark's face goes pale. He turns slowly, fear and disbelief in his eyes, to look at Deborah.</p>
                <p>She doesn't meet his gaze. She stares at the ground, her hands trembling, caught.</p>
                <p>Ephraim stands frozen, his mask of confidence shattered. His mouth opens and closes, but no words come out. He's a man whose private sins have just been made brutally, irrevocably public.</p>
                <p><strong>INT. CHURCH OFFICE - NIGHT</strong></p>
                <p>Hours later. The gala is over. The silence in the office is deafening. EPHRAIM sits slumped in a chair, his tie undone, looking like a puppet with its strings cut. Two CHURCH ELDERS sit across from him, their faces a mixture of disappointment and sadness.</p>
                <p><strong>CHURCH ELDER 1</strong></p>
                <blockquote>The board has met, and the decision is final. The evidence is incontrovertible. We have received statements from both Sarah and Deborah.</blockquote>
                <p>Ephraim says nothing. He simply stares at the floor.</p>
                <p><strong>CHURCH ELDER 2</strong></p>
                <blockquote>We are all deeply saddened, Ephraim. You have done so much for this community. But the truth is, we cannot have a leader who preaches one thing and practices another. You've caused a great deal of pain and scandal.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>I... I have.</blockquote>
                <p>His voice is a whisper.</p>
                <p><strong>CHURCH ELDER 1</strong></p>
                <blockquote>For the integrity of the church, you are hereby suspended indefinitely. All pastoral duties are to be ceased, effective immediately.</blockquote>
                <p>Ephraim looks up, the reality finally hitting him.</p>
                <p><strong>EPHRAIM</strong></p>
                <blockquote>So that's it? I'm out?</blockquote>
                <p><strong>CHURCH ELDER 2</strong></p>
                <blockquote>We will pray for you, brother. But this is a matter that must be handled with truth and accountability. As you said so eloquently in your own sermon... "our Lord sees all."</blockquote>
                <p>Ephraim looks at his hands, trembling slightly. The words he had just preached have come back to expose him.</p>
